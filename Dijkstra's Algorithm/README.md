This folder includes graphs in vanilla Python, and uses those graphs to compute Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between any two nodes.

Graph Implementation uses Object Oriented Programming to develop working graphs and some default functionalities such as adding edges or vertexes with their corresponding weights, and allows you to design both directed and undirected graphs.

Dijkstra's Algorithm stems from the other program to then run the algorithm using Object Oriented Programming with a scalable approach that allows you to find the shortest path possible between any two nodes.
