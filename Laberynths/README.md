This folder includes two pathfinding algorithms that solve simple mazes.

All mazes are automatically generated using a maze generator designed by CHAT-GPT, and then solved by using water fill (knowing the starting and ending position inside the maze).

Brut2D includes a simpler version that solves mazes in 2D and prints the output.
Brut3D_Objetos is a more complex approach using Object Oriented Programming that can design and solve mazes in 3D.
