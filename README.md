# Pathfinding-Algorithms
This Repository includes the implementation of several pathfinding algorithms with a consistent object based design.
The main objective is to be able to develop graphs in vanilla Python and show solutions to them, examining the behaviour of the algorithms under different circumstances (such as weighted, unweighted, directed and undirected graphs).
